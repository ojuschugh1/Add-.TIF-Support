# Add-.TIF-Support
To use this code, follow these steps:

Create a new HTML file and save it with a .html extension, for example, tiff-converter.html.
Download the Tiff.js library from the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/seikichi/tiff.js) and save it to the same directory as your HTML file.
Replace the path/to/image.tif in the code with the path to your actual .TIF image file.
Open the HTML file in a web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Click on the "Choose File" button to select a .TIF image file.
Click on the "Convert to JPEG" button to convert the .TIF image to JPEG format and display it in the container.
Note that you can customize the HTML file and the JavaScript code to suit your needs, such as changing the output image format or adjusting the memory allocation for Tiff.js.
